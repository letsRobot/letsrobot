## Installing remotv control scripts on a Raspberry Pi

The RasPi will need the following things install so it can talk to your motors and talk to the internet. Make sure you don’t get any errors in the console when doing the step below. If you have an issue, you can run this line again, and that will usually fix it!

1. Install the required software libraries and tools. Make sure you don’t get any errors in the console when doing the step below. If you have an issue, you can run this line again, and that will usually fix it!

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg python-serial python-dev libgnutls28-dev espeak python-smbus python-pip libttspico-utils git
   ```

2. Download the remotv control scripts from our github

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/remotv/controller.git ~/remotv
   ```

3. Install python requirements

   ```sh
   sudo python -m pip install -r ~/remotv/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the new `remotv` directory

   ```sh
   cd remotv
   ```

5. Copy `controller.sample.conf` to `controller.conf`

   ```sh
   cp controller.sample.conf controller.conf
   ```

## Configure the controller

1. Edit the `controller.conf` file created in the previous section.
   ```sh
   nano controller.conf
   ```
2. Configure the `[robot]` section

   - `owner` should be the username you have registered the robot under on the remo.tv site.
   - `robot_key` is the API key for your robot that you made on the site.
   - `turn_delay` is only used by the `motor_hat` and `mdd10`. This changes how long your bot turns for. I suggest you leave this at the default value until after you bot is moving.
   - `straight_delay` is only used by the `motor_hat` and `mdd10`. This changes how long your bot turns for. I suggest you leave this at the default value until after you bot is moving.
   - `type` should be the hardware type for the motor controller of your bot. Available types are currently.
     - `adafruit_pwm`
     - `cozmo`
     - `gopigo2`
     - `gopigo3`
     - `l298n`
     - `maestro-serv`
     - `max7219`
     - `mc33926`
     - `mdd10`
     - `motor_hat`
     - `motozero`
     - `none`
     - `owi_arm`
     - `pololu`
     - `serial_board`
     - `telly`
   - Configure your hardwares section. Each hardware type can have their own section it the controller. Look through the file for a section named the same as your hardware controller. If the section exists, read through it and adjust the variable as required.

3. Configure the `[camera]` section
   - `no-mic` This allows the microphone to be disabled.
   - `no-camera` This allows the camera to be disabled.
   - `type` This sets the audio / video handler to use. Currently only ffmpeg and ffmpeg-arecord are supported.
   - `x_res` Sets the resolution for the x axis.
   - `y_res` Sets the resolution for the y axis.
   - `camera_device` Sets the device name for the camera.
   - `audio_hw_num` Set the audio hardware number for the microphone.
4. Configure the `[tts]` section
   - `tts_volume` This is the volume level you want your bot to start with.
   - `anon_tts` This allows you to enable or disable anonymous users access to your bots TTS features.
   - `filter_url_tts` This option allows URLs pasted into chat to be blocked from the TTS function.
   - `ext_chat` This enables or disables the extended chat functions.
   - `hw_hum` This is the ALSA hardware number for your pi. 0 is the first sound card and should work for most bots.
   - `type` should be the type of TTS software you are using. The currently supported TTS types are. espeak was installed in the previous steps, and makes a good default tts.
     - `espeak`
     - `fesitval`
     - `pico`
     - Amazon Polly
     - `cozmo_tts`
     - Google Cloud

## Setting up your start_robot file on the Raspberry Pi

1. Copy the `start_robot` script to your home directory.

   ```sh
   cp ~/remotv/scripts/start_robot ~
   ```

2. Add the startup script to the `crontab`

   ```sh
   crontab -e
   ```

   Note: If you accidently use the wrong editor try

   ```sh
   EDITOR=nano crontab -e
   ```

3. Insert the following text at the bottom

   ```sh
   @reboot /bin/bash /home/pi/start_robot
   ```

   Example:

   ```sh
   # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
   #
   # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
   # indicating with different fields when the task will be run
   # and what command to run for the task
   #
   # To define the time you can provide concrete values for
   # minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
   # and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
   # Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
   # daemon's notion of time and timezones.
   #
   # Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
   # email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
   #
   # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
   # at 5 a.m every week with:
   # 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
   #
   # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
   #
   # m h  dom mon dow   command

   @reboot /bin/bash /home/pi/start_robot
   ```

4. Now just plug in the Camera and USB Speaker and reboot

   ```sh
   sudo reboot
   ```

## Chat Commands

When `ext_chat` is enabled, the following chat commands are available. To use, just type them into the chat box on your bots page. These chat commands have no effect on how the site behaves, they only affect the bot. There are some functions that duplicate functions on the site. These changes are not saved and are lots on reboot.

- `.devmode X` Set dev mode. In dev mode, only the owner can drive. If demode is set to mods, your local mods can also drive [on|off|mods].
- `.anon control X` Sets if anonymous users can drive your bot [on|off].
- `.anon tts X` Sets if anonymous users messages are passed to TTS [on|of].
- `.anon X` Sets both anonymous control and tts access [on|off].
- `.tts X` Mute the bots TTS [mute|unmute]
- `.ban NAME` Ban user NAME from controlling your bots
- `.unban NAME` remove user NAME from the ban list
- `.timeout NAME` Timeout user NAME from controlling your bots for 5 minutes
- `.untimout NAME` remove user NAME from the timeout list.
- `.brightness X` set the camera brightness [0..255]
- `.contrast X` set the camera contrast [0..255]
- `.saturation X` set the camera saturation [0..255]
- `.stationary` Toggles stationary mode on and off. When enabled, forward / backward commands will be blocked.

Hardware modules can have their own hardware specific TTS commands.

# A note about the Raspi Cam Module

Sometimes enabling the Raspberry Pi Camera module in `raspi-config` doesn't completely load the kernel drivers for it. If you don't see `/dev/video0` on your system, or `controller.py` complains about not finding it, then do the following:

1. Enable the kernel module for your current session:

```sh
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
```

2. Tell the operating system to load the kernel module at boot going forward:

```sh
sudo cat 'bcm2835-v4l2' >> /etc/modules
```

Now you should see `video0` if you do `ls /dev/ | grep video`
